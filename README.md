# TODO List Microservices 📋

This is a modular Laravel application designed to manage TODO lists using the repository and contracts design pattern. The application is divided into microservices, allowing for scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of each module. 🚀

## Features ✨

- **TODO Management**: Create, update, and delete TODO items. ✅
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality 🔒
- **Authorization**: Control access to TODO lists based on user roles and permissions. 🔑
- **Modular Design**: Each microservice focuses on specific functionality, allowing for easier development and maintenance. 🧩
- **Repository Pattern**: Implements the repository pattern to abstract data persistence and provide a consistent interface for working with different data sources. 📦
- **Contracts**: Utilizes contracts to define interfaces and enforce implementation standards, improving code reusability and flexibility. 📝
- **Scalable Architecture**: The microservices architecture enables horizontal scaling by deploying multiple instances of the same service. ⚙️
- **RESTful API**: Provides a RESTful API for seamless integration with frontend applications or third-party services. 🌐
- **Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure application reliability and correctness. ✔️
